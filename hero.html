<p>
Elon Musk started out his career co-founding x.com that had a money transferring service called paypal. In October 2002, Paypal was bought by eBay as a result of this Elon Musk received 165 million. With this newly acquired wealth Musk went on to found SpaceX, and Tesla which were both pretty successful and were what brought him to fame. Recently Musk passed Mark Zuckerberg and has become the 3rd richest person in the world.

I chose Elon Musk as my hero because of the amazing advancements his companies have made in human spaceflight and electric vehicles. SpaceX's goal seems to be making rockets more affordable and reusable which I think is really cool. Another reason I think of him as my hero is that SpaceX with NASA brough human spaceflight back to the US. Also electric cars are good for the environment so more advancements in that are cool.
